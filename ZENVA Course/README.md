### Course Description

Build websites, webapps, and more by learning the primary foundation for all web development â€“ HTML.

HTML, which stands for Hypertext Markup Language, is the core pillar of web development that dictates the structure and base appearance of every webpage.  Not only is it a fundamental starting point for any developer pursuing web development, but it also plays a crucial role as you develop your skills further with CSS and JavaScript.

In this course, you will develop a strong set of HTML skills needed to get started on your web development journey, as you learn both to structure your page, add specific elements, and even start adding website interactivity.
